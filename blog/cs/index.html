<h2 class="post-title"><a href="http://www.samvitjain.com/blog/cs/">On Computer Science</a></h2>

<p class="date">15 Sep 2017</p>

<p>I wrote my first computer programs in 6th grade for a school “science” fair (anything remotely scientific qualified) -- a C program to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit (and back), and a C program to solve a quadratic equation, given its coefficients.</p>
<p>I was not impressed. I thought programming was dull and artificial. When a computer could go from bits and bytes in silicon to printing English text on my monitor, a seemingly incredible feat, why did we need humans to write code to teach it how to use arithmetic operations (1st grade math) to compute algebraic functions (8th grade math)?</p>
<p>I gave programming a second shot in the summer before 9th grade. I made more progress this time -- learning the C language to a commendable extent, up to structures and pointers -- but was bored to death by the process. So much effort to pick up a dry, formal human artifact, a mere tool for expressing computation. In my mind, the ideas worth learning were the unchanging ones, ideas like the wave-particle duality of light and the fundamental conservation laws -- beautiful, physical truths about our universe, expressed in mathematics, that would exist even if no humans discovered them.</p>
<p>My culminating project that summer was a Sudoku solver. Given a valid initialization of the Sudoku grid, my program could use the two or three basic heuristics I knew to output a solution to easy puzzles. Intrigued but not fascinated, I put programming on the back-burner once again.</p>
<p>The breakthrough happened in the summer after my freshman year of college, in 2014. The previous summer, I had learnt the basics of making apps for my iPhone 4, my first smartphone. I loved music, and I loved sharing it with friends and family -- so I began work on an app to make sharing links fast, simple, and personal.</p>
<p>2014 was the height of <a href="../assets/links/startups-social-local-mobile.pdf">social-local-mobile</a>. The idea that two Stanford students could build something for their phone in their dorm that was almost as valuable as a car company or an oil company struck me as bizarre and incredible. I was joining a revolution.</p>
<p>I think my biggest shock, and probably the biggest shock for anyone who invents something or builds something new for the first time, no matter how humble, is that it worked.</p>
<p>I had a vision for what this app would do, and after a few weeks of coding, I was using it -- my family was using it, it was real.</p>
<p>There was instant gratification. I had an idea for a feature -- say, forwarding links -- and after half a day of hacking in Xcode, I had it in my hands.</p>
<p>For the first time, programming blew my mind. That I could build a module on my phone that could access anything on the Internet -- from YouTube to my own web server -- with just a single line of code, and that could communicate with a clone of itself installed on another phone in another country, simply by reading and writing messages to a database somewhere in the Amazon cloud -- was almost as exciting to me as the idea that the same theory that explains nuclear power explains the Sun and stars and the mechanics of space and time.</p>
<p>I had felt some angst freshman year. Why was I studying computer science? I liked using mathematical models to explain real phenomena -- an idea that underlay my interest in physics in high school, and my interest in economics early in college. What was computer science about? Why were computers, a human creation, worth studying?</p>
<p>For me, that summer with LinkMeUp was the turning point. At the risk of sounding a little cliché, I knew at that point what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, and I haven’t looked back since.</p>
<p>I’m now a grad student studying machine learning and distributed systems, and I’ll still admit that computer science, even at its deepest, isn’t as profound or as beautiful as physics.</p>
<p>But fascination is not what draws me to the field (though distributed databases <em>are</em> pretty cool). It’s a more mature appreciation that it is computer scientists who helped put man on the moon, placed the world’s collective knowledge in a small device in my pocket, and put two billion people and counting on a previously faceless Internet. It's an understanding that it is <em>computer scientists</em> -- inventors and engineers, not thinkers or writers -- who will tackle the big challenges of the 21st century: reversing the impact of two centuries of industrialization, diagnosing disease and eliminating it from the human genome, and correcting the malfunctions of the greatest intelligent machine we've yet seen: the human mind.</p>
