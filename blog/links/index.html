<p>The bar for making this list is extremely high. I only selected articles in areas in which I have some background in, so as to be able to distinguish the good writing and ideas from the absolutely exceptional. Organized roughly in order of general applicability:</p>
<h3 id="life-advice">Life Advice</h3>
<h4 id="the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short-sam-altman-apr-2015"><a href="http://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short">The days are long but the decades are short</a> (Sam Altman, Apr 2015)</h4>
<p><strong>1</strong> Never put your family, friends, or significant other low on your priority list. Prefer a handful of truly close friends to a hundred acquaintances. Don’t lose touch with old friends. Occasionally stay up until the sun rises talking to people. Have parties.</p>
<p><strong>2</strong> Life is not a dress rehearsal—this is probably it. Make it count. Time is extremely limited and goes by fast. Do what makes you happy and fulfilled—few people get remembered hundreds of years after they die anyway...</p>
<p><strong>3</strong> How to succeed: pick the right thing to do (this is critical and usually ignored), focus, believe in yourself (especially when others tell you it’s not going to work), develop personal connections with people that will help you, learn to identify talented people, and work hard. It’s hard to identify what to work on because original thought is hard.</p>
<p><strong>4</strong> On work: it’s difficult to do a great job on work you don’t care about...Work very hard—a surprising number of people will be offended that you choose to work hard—but not so hard that the rest of your life passes you by. Aim to be the best in the world at whatever you do professionally. Even if you miss, you’ll probably end up in a pretty good place...</p>
<p><strong>19</strong> Go out of your way to help people. Few things in life are as satisfying. Be nice to strangers. Be nice even when it doesn’t matter.</p>
<p><strong>22</strong> This too shall pass.</p>

<p>[On What To Work On] It’s not easy to figure out what you actually care about– there are so many directions you can go. But rather than listening to where other people might push you, it’s worth trying to figure this out for yourself. Don’t chase other people’s ideas of what matters. The best way to succeed long-term is to deeply believe that what you’re doing matters.</p>
<p>[On Achieving Success] You should work really hard. You should be willing to do whatever it takes; society doesn’t owe you success. Be a doer, not a talker – history belongs to the doers.</p>
<!--[On Finding Your People] Help others for no reason at all. When you’re young, you tend to have a small network, and that limits your options. When you help people without any intention of ever getting benefit back, doors and new connections will open – this has been super important for me.-->
<p>[On Taking Risk] Simple tip – don’t be afraid to ask for what you want. If you’re doing something ambitious, you’ll be told “no”, a lot. Sometimes though, people will give you what you want. Those times will outweigh the pains of being rejected, so be aggressive.</p>
<p>[On Money] When I was young, I had a misconception that you get rich from making a nice salary. As I got older, I realized the way to get rich was by owning things that go up in value—i.e., equity.</p>
<h4 id="life-is-short-paul-graham-jan-2016"><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html">Life Is Short</a> (Paul Graham, Jan 2016)</h4>
<p>Life is short, as everyone knows. When I was a kid I used to wonder about this. Is life actually short, or are we really complaining about its finiteness? Would we be just as likely to feel life was short if we lived 10 times as long?</p>
<p>Having kids showed me how to convert a continuous quantity, time, into discrete quantities. You only get 52 weekends with your 2 year old. If Christmas-as-magic lasts from say ages 3 to 10, you only get to watch your child experience it 8 times. And while it's impossible to say what is a lot or a little of a continuous quantity like time, 8 is not a lot of something. If you had a handful of 8 peanuts, or a shelf of 8 books to choose from, the quantity would definitely seem limited, no matter what your lifespan was.</p>
<p>If life is short, we should expect its shortness to take us by surprise. And that is just what tends to happen. You take things for granted, and then they're gone. You think you can always write that book, or climb that mountain, or whatever, and then you realize the window has closed. The saddest windows close when other people die. Their lives are short too. After my mother died, I wished I'd spent more time with her. I lived as if she'd always be there. And in her typical quiet way she encouraged that illusion. But an illusion it was. I think a lot of people make the same mistake I did.</p>
<h4 id="commencement-speech-at-hamilton-college-peter-thiel-may-2016"><a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/276303">Commencement Speech at Hamilton College</a> (Peter Thiel, May 2016)</h4>
<p>I did well enough in law school to be hired by a big New York law firm, but it turned out to be a very strange place. From the outside, everybody wanted to get in, and from the inside, everybody wanted to get out.</p>
<p>When I left the firm, after seven months and three days, my coworkers were surprised. One of them told me that he hadn’t known it was possible to escape from Alcatraz. Now that might sound odd, because all you had to do to escape was walk through the front door and not come back. But people really did find it very hard to leave, because so much of their identity was wrapped up in having won the competitions to get there in the first place.</p>
<p>Just as I was leaving the law firm, I got an interview for a Supreme Court clerkship. This is sort of the top prize you can get as a lawyer. It was the absolute last stage of the competition. But I lost. At the time I was totally devastated. It seemed just like the end of the world.</p>
<p>Looking back at my ambition to become a lawyer, it looks less like a plan for the future and more like an alibi for the present... When I co-founded a technology startup, we took the opposite approach. We consciously set out to change the direction of the world: very definite, very big plans. Our goal was nothing less than to replace the U.S. dollar by creating a new digital currency... Outside, there were millions of people working in the global financial industry, and when we told some of them about our plans we noticed a clear pattern: the more experience someone had in banking, the more certain they were that our venture could never succeed.</p>
<p>They were wrong. People around the world now rely on PayPal to move more than $200 billion every year. We did fail at our greater goal. The dollar’s still dominant... [But] more importantly, we learned that while doing new things is difficult, it is far from impossible.</p>
<p>Let me end today by questioning two clichés in particular:</p>
<p>The first comes from Shakespeare, who wrote this well-known piece of advice: 'To thine own self be true.' Now Shakespeare wrote that, but he didn’t say it. He put it in the mouth of a character named Polonius, who Hamlet accurately describes as a tedious old fool, even though Polonius was senior counselor to the King of Denmark.</p>
<p>And so, in reality, Shakespeare is telling us two things. First, do not be true to yourself. How do you know you even have such a thing as a self? Your self might be motivated by competition with others, like I was. You need to discipline your self, to cultivate it and care for it. Not to follow it blindly. Second, Shakespeare’s saying that you should be skeptical of advice, even from your elders. Polonius is a father speaking to his daughter, but his advice is terrible. Here Shakespeare’s a faithful example of our western tradition, which does not honor what is merely inherited.</p>
<p>The other cliché goes like this: 'Live each day as if it were your last.' The best way to take this as advice is to do exactly the opposite. Live each day as if you will live forever. That means, first and foremost, that you should treat the people around you as if they too will be around for a very long time to come. The choices that you make today matter, because their consequences will grow greater and greater.</p>
<!-- [The Top of My Todo List](http://www.paulgraham.com/todo.html) (Paul Graham, April 2012)

I would like to avoid making these mistakes. But how do you avoid mistakes you make by default? ... So I inverted the 5 regrets, yielding a list of 5 commands

> Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy. -->
<h4 id="follow-a-career-passion-let-it-follow-you-cal-newport-sep-2012"><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/30/jobs/follow-a-career-passion-let-it-follow-you.html">Follow a Career Passion? Let It Follow You</a> (Cal Newport, Sep 2012)</h4>
<p>Growing up, we were told by guidance counselors, career advice books, the news media and others to “follow our passion.” This advice assumes that we all have a pre-existing passion waiting to be discovered. If we have the courage to discover this calling and to match it to our livelihood, the thinking goes, we’ll end up happy. If we lack this courage, we’ll end up bored and unfulfilled — or, worse, in law school.</p>
<p>As I considered my options during my senior year of college, I knew all about this Cult of Passion and its demands. But I chose to ignore it. The alternative career philosophy that drove me is based on this simple premise: The traits that lead people to love their work are general and have little to do with a job’s specifics. These traits include a sense of autonomy and the feeling that you’re good at what you do and are having an impact on the world.</p>
<p>These traits can be found in many jobs, but they have to be earned. Building valuable skills is hard and takes time. For someone in a new position, the right question is not, “What is this job offering me?” but, instead, “What am I offering this job?”</p>
<p>To other young people who constantly wonder if the grass might be greener on the other side of the occupational fence, I offer this advice: Passion is not something you follow. It’s something that will follow you as you put in the hard work to become valuable to the world.</p>
<!-- #### [The Trouble with Optionality](http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2017/5/25/desai-commencement-ed/) (Mihir Desai, May 2017)

I’ve lost count of the number of students who, when describing their career goals, talk about their desire to “maximize optionality.” They’re referring to financial instruments known as options that confer the right to do something rather than an obligation to do something...

This emphasis on creating optionality can backfire in surprising ways. Instead of enabling young people to take on risks and make choices, acquiring options becomes habitual. You can never create enough option value—and the longer you spend acquiring options, the harder it is to stop. -->
<!-- The Yale undergraduate goes to work at McKinsey for two years, then comes to Harvard Business School, then graduates and goes to work Goldman Sachs and leaves after several years to work at Blackstone. Optionality abounds! -->
<h3 id="startups">Startups</h3>
<!-- [Introduction to Startups](../assets/links/startups-introduction.pdf) (Balaji Srinivasan) -->
<h4 id="how-to-make-wealth-paul-graham-may-2004"><a href="http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html">How To Make Wealth</a> (Paul Graham, May 2004)</h4>
<p>Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to compress your whole working life into a few years. Instead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four. This pays especially well in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.</p>
<p>Startups are not magic. They don't change the laws of wealth creation. They just represent a point at the far end of the curve. There is a conservation law at work here: if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars' worth of pain. For example, one way to make a million dollars would be to work for the Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your salary. Imagine the stress of working for the Post Office for fifty years. In a startup you compress all this stress into three or four years. You do tend to get a certain bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain, but you can't evade the fundamental conservation law. If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it...</p>
<p>To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage. You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have a big effect.</p>
<p>An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would be lead actor in a movie. Your performance can be measured in the gross of the movie. And you have leverage in the sense that your performance can make or break it.</p>
<p>I think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will be found to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars, hedge fund managers, professional athletes. A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure...</p>
<p>Making wealth is not the only way to get rich. For most of human history it has not even been the most common. Until a few centuries ago, the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs, land, and cattle, and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance, marriage, conquest, or confiscation. Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.</p>
<h4 id="idea-execution-and-market-balaji-srinivasan-june-2013"><a href="../assets/links/startups-idea-execution-market.pdf">Idea, Execution, and Market</a> (Balaji Srinivasan, June 2013)</h4>
<p>So which is most important: product/idea, execution/team, or market?</p>
<p>One answer is that for a startup veteran or someone who understands any machine learning, the debate is somewhat moot. All these factors (idea, execution, market, team, product) are important to varying degrees; the main point of saying “it’s the execution, not the idea” is to disabuse a novice of the idea that patents matter much at inception, or that a brilliant idea on a napkin* has much value. You can think of these things on a continuum. Ideas range in quality from “a social network for dogs” to “Maxwell’s equations”, and execution ranges in quality from “I’ll start a company some day” to “sold or IPO’d company”. As important as the execution is, without a clear vision of where you want your company to go you will never come up with an idea that others want to copy. So how do you come up with a good idea?</p>
<p>*One argument is that a novel equation or figure is an exception, such as Ramanujan’s notebooks or the Feynman diagrams. Something like that truly is valuable, more in the sense of I’ve developed a low-cost way to launch objects into space than I have an idea for a social network for pet owners...</p>
<p>Even if you can build a product with an economy of scale, you need to ensure that it serves a large market. The annual market size is the total number of people who will buy the product per year multiplied by the price point. To get to a billion dollars in annual revenue ($1B), you need either a high price point or a large number of customers. Here are a few different ways to achieve that magic $1B figure in different industries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sell product at $1 to 1 billion: Coca Cola (cans of soda)</li>
<li>$10 to 100 million: Johnson and Johnson (household products)</li>
<li>$100 to 10 million: Blizzard (World of Warcraft)</li>
<li>$1,000 to 1 million: Lenovo (laptops)</li>
<li>$10,000 to 100,000: Toyota (cars)</li>
<li>$100,000 to 10,000: Oracle (enterprise software)</li>
<li>$1,000,000 to 1,000: Countrywide (high-end mortgages)</li>
</ul>
<!-- [How To Get Startup Ideas](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html) (Paul Graham, Nov 2012)

The very best startup ideas tend to have three things in common: they're something the founders themselves want, that they themselves can build, and that few others realize are worth doing. Microsoft, Apple, Yahoo, Google, and Facebook all began this way.

[School] That's what I'd advise college students to do, rather than trying to learn about "entrepreneurship." "Entrepreneurship" is something you learn best by doing it. The examples of the most successful founders make that clear...

Or don't take any extra classes, and just build things. It's no coincidence that Microsoft and Facebook both got started in January. At Harvard that is (or was) Reading Period, when students have no classes to attend because they're supposed to be studying for finals.

Beware of research. If an undergrad writes something all his friends start using, it's quite likely to represent a good startup idea. Whereas a PhD dissertation is extremely unlikely to. For some reason, the more a project has to count as research, the less likely it is to be something that could be turned into a startup. I think the reason is that the subset of ideas that count as research is so narrow that it's unlikely that a project that satisfied that constraint would also satisfy the orthogonal constraint of solving users' problems. -->
<h4 id="sociallocalmobile-virality-and-growth-balaji-srinivasan-june-2013"><a href="../assets/links/startups-social-local-mobile.pdf">Social/Local/Mobile, Virality, and Growth</a> (Balaji Srinivasan, June 2013)</h4>
<p><strong>The Virality Equation</strong></p>
<p>In thinking about virality, there are three components to the virality equation:</p>
<ul>
<li>p ∈ [0, 1]: the probability that a given person decides to share</li>
<li>N ∈ [0, ∞): the number of people who the invite is shared with</li>
<li>τ ∈ [0, ∞): the time interval between shares</li>
</ul>
<p>Most people’s intuition tells them that the ideal way to build something highly viral is to improve the content, namely improving the value of p. However, suppose that we quantify the number of users at successive timepoints who have seen the content via <span class="math inline"><em>U</em>(<em>t</em>)</span> as follows, with <span class="math inline"><em>U</em>(0)=1</span>: <br /><span class="math display">$$
\begin{aligned}
U(τ) &amp;= (N p) \\
U(mτ) &amp;= (N p)^m \\
U(t) &amp;= (N p)^{(t/τ)}
\end{aligned}
$$</span><br /> Here we have substituted <span class="math inline"><em>t</em> = <em>m</em><em>τ</em></span> in the final line. We see immediately that if <span class="math inline"><em>N</em> ⋅ <em>p</em> &lt; 1</span> we do not have viral growth. We can also ask an important question: what’s the relative impact of increasing p by 2-fold, increasing N by 2-fold, or decreasing τ by 2-fold?...</p>
<!-- For concreteness, let’s say that p = .1, N = 50, and τ = 1 day. Then after three days we would have roughly:
$$
\begin{aligned}
U(3) = (.1 × 50)^{3/1} = 125\text{ users}
\end{aligned}
$$
If we doubled p to .2 we’d get:
$$
\begin{aligned}
U(3) = (.2 × 50)^{3/1} = 1000\text{ users}
\end{aligned}
$$
And if we doubled N to 100 we’d get:
$$
\begin{aligned}
U(3) = (.1 × 100)^{3/1} = 1000\text{ users}
\end{aligned}
$$
But if we halved τ to .5 we’d get:
$$
\begin{aligned}
U(3) = (.1 × 50)^{3/.5} = 15625\text{ users}
\end{aligned}
$$ -->
<p>Wow! The impact of reductions in τ is highly nonlinear because it affects the exponent in the virality equation. Shorter incubation times mean rapid viral spread...</p>
<p>Putting these things together, we can start to gain more insight as to why the Reddit image macro is the Ebola meme. An image meme is instantly processed (<span class="math inline"><em>τ</em> → 0</span>) and understood by a wide audience (<span class="math inline"><em>N</em> → ∞</span>). It thus need only be shared by a small fraction of people to achieve incredible viral growth. Here are a few more historical examples of successful viral campaigns that illustrate various optimizations of p, N, and τ...</p>
<!-- Social, Local, and Mobile. The mantra of venture capitalists from roughly 2007-2012. It’s a catchphrase, a buzzword, and arguably a cliche in Silicon Valley. The term and its relatives attract disparagement because they are so closely associated with photosharing, social gaming, check-ins, and recreational apps of this nature. Now, there’s actually much that is admirable about the companies in these areas: Instagram is a highly complex engineering feat, Snapchat does account for a significant fraction of all photos taken in the world, and Zynga was, at one point at least, a multibillion dollar public company...-->
<!-- Still, these are with some justification seen as cotton candy apps, as the kind of apps that healthy twenty-somethings make for each other, rather than apps that solve problems of real significance. But is that really all there is to say about “social, local, and mobile”, though? -->

<h3 id="grad-school">Grad School</h3>
<h4 id="i-loved-graduate-school-peter-bailis-jan-2016"><a href="http://www.bailis.org/blog/i-loved-graduate-school/">I Loved Graduate School</a> (Peter Bailis, Jan 2016)</h4>
<p>Getting a Ph.D. is an extreme growth experience. In four to six (or more) years, you are expected to become a world expert in a topic, produce original results, and communicate them to your field. Becoming an expert in anything is hard. But consider this: by the time you’re done with your dissertation, you’ll have answered questions no one ever answered (or possibly asked) before...</p>
<p>This all requires developing a highly diverse skill set in a very short time period. This is hard. It’s one of the hardest things I know to do. Getting a Ph.D. requires creativity, courage, a hefty dose of stubbornness, and a lot of hard work. People will help you, as they helped me, by providing wisdom and guidance and training, but it’s ultimately up to you to do the original research...</p>
<p>Make no mistake: graduate school has a high opportunity cost. In computer science, you’re likely giving up over $100,000 per year to be in school. In expectation, in monetary terms, a Ph.D. in Computer Science is not worth your time.</p>
<p>That said, with a Ph.D. in Computer Science, you can do many things:...</p>

<h4 id="undergraduate-research-tips-smitha-milli-mar-2017"><a href="http://smithamilli.com/blog/undergrad-tips/">Undergraduate Research Tips</a> (Smitha Milli, Mar 2017)</h4>
<p>To get into grad school prioritize (publishable) research over classes. Grad school is very competitive. For example, only ~3% of applicants get into the top AI/ML programs and this is only going to get worse in the future. Whenever you have a situation where only the top x% (where x is small) get a prize and everyone else gets nothing, you should focus on the important and high variance properties that distinguish you from the rest. In this case, what you should not focus on is your grades. Everyone gets high grades, so it’s low variance and not useful in picking who gets admitted. What actually provides information to distinguish people is their research. The problem is you can’t get bad grades (&lt;A) either because that’s a red flag. So the trick here is to take fewer classes and use your extra time to do more research.</p>

<!-- [Undergraduation](http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html) (Paul Graham, Mar 2005)

What should you do in college to become a good hacker? There are two main things you can do: become very good at programming, and learn a lot about specific, cool problems. These turn out to be equivalent, because each drives you to do the other.

The way to be good at programming is to work (a) a lot (b) on hard problems. And the way to make yourself work on hard problems is to work on some very engaging project...

Another way to figure out which fields are worth studying is to create the dropout graph. For example, I know many people who switched from math to computer science because they found math too hard, and no one who did the opposite. People don't do hard things gratuitously; no one will work on a harder problem unless it is proportionately (or at least log(n)) more rewarding. So probably math is more worth studying than computer science. By similar comparisons you can make a graph of all the departments in a university. At the bottom you'll find the subjects with least intellectual content. -->
