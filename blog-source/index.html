<p> I write about artificial intelligence, computer systems, and the technology industry. </p>

<p> I also periodically discuss important research papers. <!-- I begin by introducing the core contributions, and then tie the paper to a broader idea or trend via an engaging analysis. --> My criteria for selecting papers is the following: 1) the paper must already be accepted to a top-tier computer science conference, and 2) the paper must have been published in the last 8 years. The papers I discuss span the disciplines of machine learning (ICML, NIPS), computer vision (CVPR), databases (SIGMOD, VLDB), and classical systems (NSDI, SOSP). </p>
