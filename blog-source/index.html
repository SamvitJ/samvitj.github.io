<p> I blog about artificial intelligence, computer systems, and the technology industry. </p>

<p> I also periodically discuss important research papers. <!--I begin by introducing the core contributions, and then tie the paper to a broader idea or trend via an engaging analysis.--> My criteria for selecting papers is the following: 1) the paper must already be published in a top-tier computer science conference, and 2) it must have been written in the last 8 years. The papers I discuss span the disciplines of machine learning (ICML, NIPS), computer vision (CVPR), databases (SIGMOD, VLDB), and classical systems (NSDI, OSDI). </p>
