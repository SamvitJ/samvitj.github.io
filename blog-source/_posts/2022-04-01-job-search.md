In 2022, I ran my first serious job search as an "in career" engineer.

In all, I applied to 41 companies,[^1] began the interview process with 14, and completed final rounds (virtual onsites) with 11 companies (Gusto, Brex, Plaid, Sigma, Pinterest, Dropbox, Figma, Noom, Airtable, Robust Intelligence, Google).

Of these 11 onsites, three were for machine learning engineer (MLE) roles, and the remaining eight for mid-level software engineer (SWE) positions.

Taken together, I completed 35 coding interviews (15 phone screens, 20 onsite), 7 system design, 5 machine learning, 5 miscellaneous technical, and 15 behavioral interviews. This comes out to a total of 68 interview rounds.

My search also involved 80 additional conversations with recruiters, hiring managers, and other team members (engineers, leaders) across various stages of the process, from initial screens, to onsite prep, to the offer phase.

In total, then, my job search involved 148 conversations, most of which occured over a three month period in 2022.

Here are some interesting and/or surprising things I learned through this process:


### 1. LeetCode-style coding problems are not the norm

Contrary to prevailing wisdom on the Internet, most companies do NOT ask LeetCode-style programming questions. Let that fact sink in...

In my experience, the current industry norm is "practical" programming problems loosely inspired by what the company actually does. As a general rule, companies seem to place the highest value on writing code that runs successfully on simple test cases, and secondarily, on good communication, clean code, and quick iteration.

If you know the basic features of one programming language well (conditionals, loops, functions, classes), and can apply three data stuctures - lists, hash tables, and linked lists - in that language, you should be set for most coding interviews. Add heaps and trees/graphs to that, and you are pretty much as prepared as you need to be.

The 80-20 rule really applies to coding interview prep. Rather than aiming to become a virtuoso, put in the effort to gain basic interviewing proficiency in your language of choice. Twenty percent of the work required to become a LeetCode "expert" puts you in a position to ace more than eighty percent of your coding interviews.

That said, LeetCode is a great way to build this proficiency, especially if you've decided to start interviewing in a new language. **Pro tip**: Get a LeetCode Premium subscription. At $35 a month, it's a real bargain, given that just a couple weeks of practice can dramatically improve your interviewing performance.

LeetCode Premium gives you access to solutions and lets you solve problems in order of "frequency" (how often they are seen in real interviews). I've found reading solutions to be a really underrated hack to level up as a coder: it's a great way to expand your repertoire of problem solving techniques and learn the advanced features of a language.[^2]

To date, I've solved 20 LeetCode "easy" problems and 73 LeetCode "mediums". Of these, I solved 34 mediums while in my last job search. I found this to be more than enough practice to approach my coding interviews.


### 2. If you can, use Python

Using a concise, dynamically interpeted language like Python conveys a tremendous speed advantage that can dramatically increase your interview pass rate.

As it turned out, I had always understimated this speed advantage, and overestimated the switching costs of moving from another language (e.g. Java, C++) to Python.

In my most recent job search, I used Python exclusively, and to great effect.


### 3. System Design is (easily) learnable

System design preparation begins and ends with one book: the aptly-named "[System Design Interview](https://www.amazon.com/System-Design-Interview-insiders-Second/dp/B08CMF2CQF)" by Alex Yu.

In fact, reading merely the 30-page first chapter of this book, titled "Scale from Zero to Millions of Users", and internalizing Figure 1-23 on page 29, will give you all of the tools you need to approach this interview.

(For best results, consider reading maybe one or two more chapters of this book. Each of chapters 4-15 walks through the solution of a canonical system design problem. I recommend reading "Chapter 8: Design a URL Shortener.")

I found system design interviews to be surprisingly fun and doable, despite never actually having designed a "real system" in industry before (hint: most engineers rarely design web-scale systems from scratch in their day-to-day jobs).


### 4. Be bold but respectful

There's never been a better time in history to be a software engineer. The leverage software engineers have in today's market is unparalleled, given the scarcity of engineering talent relative to available capital and opportunities to start companies. This is especially true just outside of the FAANG companies, which happen to be deluged with applicants, and can afford to be arbitrarily selective.

Use this leverage well. Lot of companies will want to talk to you, especially if you have some experience and industry pedigree. Be courteous to and engaged with each individual you interact with, and treat each interaction as an opportunity to learn more about the industry, connect with amazing people, and expand your professional network.


### 5. Be open minded

There are lots of companies outside of FAANG that pay extremely well, and will offer the opportunity for at least as much impact and career growth. Go into the job search with an open mind, be on the lookout for cool companies that you might have overlooked, and talk to friends and industry connections to learn more about what's up and coming!

[^1]: Applying to 41 companies seems like a lot, but I was actually reasonably deliberate about my applications. There are several well-known tech companies and industry sectors (e.g. finance) that I explicitly decided not to apply to.
