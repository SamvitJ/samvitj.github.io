I just finished my 6th book of 2021, and I thought I’d make a post about it. (Also, people who read like 1+ book a week on top of work - how do you do it?? I’m slow. Sorry. This is a big deal for me.)

Of these books, I really liked five of them. In reverse chronological order:

</p>

- [Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?](https://www.amazon.com/Everyone-Hanging-Without-Other-Concerns/dp/0307886271) - Writer and actress Mindy Kaling’s first memoir. If you enjoyed The Office or the teen dramedy Never Have I Ever (guilty), this is a tell-all from the wonderful person who brought those shows into existence. If you also secretly dream of moonlighting as a writer or professional comedian... why aren’t you reading this already?

- [Freakonomics](https://www.amazon.com/Freakonomics-Economist-Explores-Hidden-Everything/dp/0060731338) - A super well-known book that actually lives up to its hype. If you like (over)applying economics to everyday life, or thinking about causality in the social sciences, don’t miss out.

- [Amazon Unbound](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Unbound-Invention-Global-Empire/dp/1982132612) - This was probably my favorite book of the year. A newly released, 500-page honeycomb of investigative journalism into the last decade of Amazon history, this is sure to delight. Particularly recommended if you are (1) a business geek or (2) interested in how Amazon Go, Studios, Prime Day, Marketplace, Fresh, Logistics, Advertising, and more came to be. Sequel to the “The Everything Store”.

- [Fooled by Randomness](https://www.amazon.com/Fooled-Randomness-Hidden-Markets-Incerto/dp/0812975219) - If you think that everything that’s wrong with the world can be boiled down to sampling biases (survivorship, availability, ...), or compare yourself to others more than you should, read this book. First book in Nassim Nicholas Taleb’s “Incerto” series. (NNT: questionable behavior on Twitter, amazing thinker and writer.)

- [Doing Justice: A Prosecutor’s Thoughts on Crime, Punishment and the Rule of Law](https://www.amazon.com/Doing-Justice-Prosecutors-Thoughts-Punishment/dp/0525562931/) - This might be my *second* favorite book of the year. War stories from Preet Bharara, the nation’s top prosecuting attorney from 2009 to 2017. A gripping memoir from the soft-spoken badass who brought rogue hedge funds, the Mafia, money launderers, corrupt public officials, and cybercriminals to justice. Not to be missed.

- [Mindset: The New Psychology of Success](https://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Carol-S-Dweck/dp/0345472322) - My first book after a long reading hiatus (i.e., basically all of 2020), this is a feel-good, self-help thriller that is sure to get your juices flowing. Beats to death the virtues of the superpower that is a “learning mindset”. I was kidding about it being a thriller, it is actually a pretty repetitive book.

Honorable mentions - book I did not finish, but wish I had:

- [Staff Engineer](https://www.amazon.com/Staff-Engineer-Leadership-beyond-management/dp/1736417916) - I read a big chunk of this on a flight from Boston, and learned a lot. Books about the career path I’m actually on stress me out, so I didn’t finish it.

- [The Blank Slate: The Modern Denial of Human Nature](https://www.amazon.com/Blank-Slate-Modern-Denial-Nature/dp/0142003344) - Steven Pinker is my favorite non-fiction writer of all time, and if you’re at all suspicious that the nature-vs-nurture debate is not settled, this book is for you. Answers important questions like: how much influence do parents really have on their kids' personalities? It's long, but it's a masterpiece and worth it. Read it.
