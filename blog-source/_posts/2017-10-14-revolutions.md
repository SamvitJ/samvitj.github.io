I have both a short-term/selfish reason and a long-term/altruistic reason for my interest in machine learning (ML). This post is about my short-term/selfish reason.

As many have said, we are in the golden age of machine learning. ML is going to be the most important force in the world for at least the next 30 years - a force as transformative as the personal computer and the Internet, and more transformative than the smartphone.

<!-- (If you disagree that most powerful forces are technological in nature, I encourage you to read (with a critical mind) Peter Thiel's book Zero To One.) -->

Revolutions - like machine learning, smartphones, the Internet, and personal computers - tend to create an orchard of creative opportunity, littered with both high-hanging and low-hanging fruit. This is why so many people rushed to start Internet companies in the late 1990s - including a young South African immigrant who passed on a PhD program in physics in 1995 to build a company to put Yellow Pages on the web.

In fact, some of the companies of the Internet era solved problems that didn’t exist *before* the Internet (Google), while others emerged much later, after the dust of the dot com bust had settled (Facebook, Airbnb).

The biggest winners tend to be those groups who 1) enter early, 2) identify very fundamental problems that have suddenly become solvable, and 3) execute extremely well. <!-- include "and" -->

To make concrete what I mean by "big winners", here are some examples:

- Internet: Amazon (1994), Google (1998), and Facebook (2004)
- Personal computers: Microsoft (1975) and Apple (1976)
- Smartphones: (besides Apple, Google, Facebook) potentially Uber (2009) and Snap (2011)

**Thesis**: all great businesses are associated with revolutions. These revolutions are often sparked by the "democratization" (sudden fall in marginal costs) of some key piece of enabling technology, such as compute/storage or mobile Internet access. Revolutions are often abetted by the "commoditization" (transition to undifferentiated price competition) of critical infrastructure, such as server hardware or mobile data/service. <!-- understand how "payments" and "telecommunications" became commodities -->

<!-- Other times, they involve the creation of open "platforms" (distribution channels) with wide reach, such as the web or Apple's App Store. -->
<!-- Other times, the involve the "commodification" (enabling economies of scale) -->

Notably, smaller revolutions also spawn companies. GitHub, which is backed by Sequoia Capital and now [valued](https://www.wsj.com/articles/github-raises-250-million-at-2-billion-valuation-1438206722) at $2 billion, was founded in 2007 by a group of Ruby developers in San Francisco at a time when the distributed version control system, Git, was first starting to get attention. Here, git, and open-source more broadly, was the revolution, and Tom Preston-Warner and Chris Wanstrath were the hackers who first recognized the opportunity ([1](https://www.wired.com/2012/02/github-2/), [2](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2011/05/03/rejected-bio-from-the-setup.html)).

This leads me to my short-term/selfish reason.  There is an explosion of interest in machine learning in both academia and industry, and a wide spectrum of problems (“verticals”) to which it can be clearly applied. If you’re betting your future on anything, then betting on an area showing immense promise is as good a gamble as any.
