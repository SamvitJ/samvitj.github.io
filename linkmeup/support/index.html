           <u>FAQ</u><br>
           <br>
           Q: Do I need to create a new account with the app?<br>
           <br>
           A: Not necessarily. You can use your Facebook account to signup and find your friends. This is a completely secure and standard authorization process used by many social apps. Signing up with Facebook - or linking an existing LinkMeUp account with Facebook - does NOT give LinkMeUp the permission or ability to post to your profile. <br>
           If you do not wish to link with Facebook, you can make an account by clicking the "Sign Up" button on the login screen.<br>
           <br>
           <br>
           Q: How do I add friends?<br>
           <br>
           A: There are several ways to add friends on LinkMeUp. <br>
           <br>
           You can link your address book to LinkMeUp. Your mobile contacts who currently use LinkMeUp will then be listed in the "Friend Suggestions" section of your Friends tab, from where you can send them friend requests. Note that even if a friend doesn't have the app, you can still send them links as text messages. <br>
           <br>
           If you signup with Facebook, your Facebook friends who currently use LinkMeUp will be listed in the "Friend Suggestions" section of your Friends tab. You can then send them friend requests. <br>
           <br>
           You can also search for friends by entering their username or email address in the search bar. If you use the search bar to find friends, make sure to get the spelling and capitalization of their username/email exactly correct! To protect privacy, we only list an account if there is an exact match. <br>
           <br>
           <br>
           Q: How do I reset a forgotten password?<br>
           <br>
           A: If you forget your password, simply click the vertical "Forgot?" button, located on the left side of the login screen. You will receive an email with instructions to reset your password.<br>
